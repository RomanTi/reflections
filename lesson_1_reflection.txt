How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    fast hightlights

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    view what changes were made

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    that's most logical option

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because single project stores code in multiple files related to each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git logs show the list of vesrions of files; git diff shows the difference between file versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    definetely cuz you can revert the changes quickly

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
